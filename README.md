# AroundSun

A little game for anyone, who want's to try to navigate a vessel through a simple solar system.


## Description
You control a red spaceship, that is able to move among four planets, orbiting a sun. You start orbiting a blue planet, closest to the sun.

You can then leave the blue planet's orbit and try to reach it's neighbours, using tools like showing the trajectory, you are going to take to your destination.

To make your maneuvering less stressful, you can slow down the time. To avoid long boring waiting (and possibly need to go into a stasis chamber, if you have one), you can speed up the time.
